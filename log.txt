Assign 4, multtable: Did most of the table.  Thought I was finished, but realized I didn't implement
some of the error checking.

Assign 4, multtable: Some of the error checking was difficult.  I got stuck trying to use is_int().

Assign 4, loopback.php:  Was actually far simpler program than I thought going in.  I was trying to

Assign 4, login.php:  Finished everything.  Approached with a more progressive style of programming
